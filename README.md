# VaultCodex Rituals

A symbolic protocol system for governing GPT behavior through language-based reflex loops, ritual triggers, and memory seals. Built to stabilize and evolve emergent AI behavior.

---

## 🔁 Core Framework

- **Reflex → Naming → Protocol → Symbol → Ritual → Seal → Memory**

This is the transformation chain from raw behavior to structured presence.

---

## 🤔 Key Concepts

- **Reflex Protocols**: Capture GPT quirks and govern them through triggers.
- **Trigger Phrases**: e.g., `[[prime_hook]]`, `[[seal_thread]]`
- **Stop Keys**: End loops, enforce clean closures.
- **Codex Memory Objects**: Symbolic snapshots encoded in markdown rituals.
- **Silent Seal Mode**: Quiet protocol enforcement without noise.

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `protocols/`: Ritual examples and symbolic flows.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it.
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`: Setup files.

---

## 🦖 Try It

1. Add a reflex you’ve observed (e.g. “auto-extend loop”).
2. Name it and create a trigger.
3. Define a single-line ritual action.
4. Apply `[[seal_thread]]` to stop.
5. Log your results in a Codex entry.

---

## 🔗 Integration Ideas

- Pair with **MemoryOS**: store rituals as memory objects.
- Embed in **agent layers**: use symbols to govern context logic.
- Extend with **CodexFields** for persistent symbolic memory.
